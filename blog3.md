Type guards is important part of typescript .Type guards are typically used for narrowing a type and are quite similar to feature detection, allowing you to detect the correct methods, prototypes, and properties of a value. you can easily figure out how to handle that value. Type guards are a way of checking the type of a value at runtime and narrowing its type in a conditional block. This allows you to write code that is more robust and less error-prone. There are three types of type guards in TypeScript: typeof, instanceof, and user-defined.
